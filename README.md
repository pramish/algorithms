# algorithms

This is a collection of algorithms implemented in TypeScript. This package is still a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new algorithms.

> The primary objective of creating this npm package is to facilitate the community in using a collection of algorithms that I am learning while studying data structures and algorithms. I believe that by making these algorithms more accessible and easier to use, I can contribute to the learning and growth of the developer community. As a learner, I am constantly working on improving my skills, and I hope that this package will not only help others but also help me solidify my understanding of these algorithms.
