# algorithms

This is a collection of algorithms implemented in TypeScript. This package is still a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new algorithms.

> The primary objective of creating this npm package is to facilitate the community in using a collection of algorithms that I am learning while studying data structures and algorithms. I believe that by making these algorithms more accessible and easier to use, I can contribute to the learning and growth of the developer community. As a learner, I am constantly working on improving my skills, and I hope that this package will not only help others but also help me solidify my understanding of these algorithms.


## Installation

To install this package, you can use either `npm or yarn`:

```
npm install algorithms-using-typescript
```

OR

```
yarn add algorithms-using-typescript
```

### Usage

### Bubble sort algorithm

```typescript
import { bubbleSort } from 'algorithms-using-typescript';

const unSortedArray:Array<number> = [5, 2, 7, 1, 8, 9];
const sortedArray:Array<number> = bubbleSort(arr);

console.log(sortedArr); // [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Available Algorithms
1. Sort
    - Bubble sort
